== Documentation
Python documentation uses link:http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/[Sphinx] and therefore any source code documentation is recommended to use Sphinx. 
Sphinx uses link:http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html[ReST] as its markup language of choice. Sphinx can also use markdown with an extension. Team documentation uses confluence wiki as a major source of team documents. 
For readmes, markdown is supported by github natively, although ReST and asciidoc are supported as well.
One recommendation is to include class diagrams based on the python source code. 
There are tools to help bolster this process but are not listed here yet.
